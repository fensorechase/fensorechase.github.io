I'm a second year Ph.D. student in the [Dept of Computer Science at Emory University](https://computerscience.emory.edu/index.html), advised by [Prof. Joyce Ho](https://joyceho.github.io/). My current work focuses on identifying and integrating social determinants of health (SDOH) with health records for risk stratification of patients with chronic conditions like Heart Failure (HF). I also work on multimodal machine learning methods which fuse text, images, medical codes to address problems in healthcare. My interests also include algorithmic fairness, causal inference.

Prior experience
======
I co-founded [Zuki](https://zukihealth.com/), a personal care assistant mHealth app for children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and their caregivers. I've also interned as a software engineer at JP Morgan Chase & Co, and at [Plug and Play Tech Center](https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/).

Education
======
I graduated from The Ohio State University in 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering along with Honors research distinction in Chemistry. I worked on research related to analytical chemistry in [Prof. Heather Allen's](https://research.cbc.osu.edu/allen.697/) lab, using spectroscopy and machine learning techniques to accelerate characterization of airborne/waterborne pollutants in environmental science.
